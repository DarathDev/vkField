# VkField

This is a GPU accelerated implementation of [Field II](field-ii.dk) using Vulkan.

While it can perform simulations for arbitrary sets of rectangular and triangular elements, the current front end only has functions for easy simulations of row column arrays.

## Building from Source

VkField is written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and after installation can be built by running (build.ps1) or (build.sh)
