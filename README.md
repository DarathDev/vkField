# VkField

This is a GPU accelerated implementation of [Field II](field-ii.dk) using Vulkan.

While it can perform simulations for arbitrary sets of rectangular and triangular elements, the current front end only has functions for easy simulations of row column arrays.

## Building

```shell
odin run .
```
